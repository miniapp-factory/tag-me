#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### Tag me helps user to give a tag to the media or file so that to sort them according to certains tags which hellps sorting easy  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` values to match the new “Tag me” app description.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo image you want to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized representation of a tag attached to a media file, with a simple, modern design. The tag is a rectangular shape with a small hole at the top, colored in a vibrant blue, and the media file is represented by a simple rectangle with a play button overlay in white. The background is a light gray gradient. The overall composition is centered and balanced, suitable for a logo.
